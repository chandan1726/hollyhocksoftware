						of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain
						exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and

						peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that
						adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may
						likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously
						provided informed consent. <br>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with
						consumer expectations based on your relationship with us. <br>Comply with a legal obligation.
						<br>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context
						in which you provided it. <br>We may also limit our deletion to the extent permitted by
						applicable law. <br>Exercising Your Rights. To exercise your rights, please contact us as
						follows: <br>Email us at softwarehollyhock@gmail.com and provide the following information:
						<br>Full name and email address associated with your use of our Service, and Your specific

						request via our web form on our Contact Us page (located at https://hollyhocksoftware.com/contact) and provide the following information: <br>Full name and email address
						associated with your use of our Service, and Your specific request (e.g., right to access, right
						to portability, or right to delete). <br>We will attempt to respond to a consumer request for
						access or deletion within 45 days of receiving that request. If we require more time, we will
						inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. <br>Only you, or someone legally
						authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your
						personal information. <br>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data
						portability twice within a 12-month period. <br>Non-Discrimination. We will not discriminate
						against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we
						will not: <br>Deny you goods or services, <br>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or
						services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties,
						<br>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services, or <br>Suggest that you may
						receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods
						or services. <br>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA
						that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial
						incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value to Hollyhock Software and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation

					<p>You may exercise your rights by contacting us as indicated under the “Contact Us” section below.
						<br><br>Legitimate Interest. “Legitimate interests” means the interests of Hollyhock Software in
						conducting and managing our organization. For example, we have a legitimate interest in
						processing your Personal Data to analyze how the Website and the Service are being used by you,
						and to ensure network and information security, as described in this Privacy Policy. When we
						process your Personal Data for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance
						any potential impact on you, and your rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate
						interests do not automatically override your interests. We will not use your Personal Data for
						activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, unless we have your consent
						or those activities are otherwise required or permitted to by law. You have the right to object
						to processing that is based on our legitimate interests. For more information on your rights,
						please see “Your Rights” section above.</p>
					<h3><b>International Data Transfers from Europe</b></h3>
					<p>Your personal information may be transferred to Hollyhock Software and its service providers in
						countries other than the country in which you are resident, including in the United States, and
						other locations where we have offices or employees. These countries may have data protection
						laws that are different from the laws of your country and may not provide the same level of
						protection as your country.</p>
					<h3><b>Model Clauses</b></h3>
					<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, the UK or Switzerland, we will protect your
						personal information when it is transferred outside of your jurisdiction by (a) processing it in
						a territory that provides an Hollyhock Software level of protection based on its data protection laws; or
						(b) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as relying on
						the European standard contractual clauses. Hollyhock Software currently relies on these European
						standard contractual clauses (“Model Clauses”) for data transfers.</p>
					<h3><b>Privacy Shield Notice</b></h3>
					<p>As of July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement declaring Privacy Shield
						invalid. Hollyhock Software now relies on other transfer mechanisms, such as the Model Clauses
						described above, for the cross-border transfer of data. <br><br>Hollyhock Software complies with
						the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks (“Frameworks”) as set forth by the U.S.
						Department of Commerce regarding the processing of personal data transferred from the EU and
						Switzerland to the U.S., respectively (for these purposes, reference to the EU also includes the
						European Economic Area countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Hollyhock Software has
						certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles (described below). If there is any
						conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy, the EU or Swiss Privacy Shield Principles
						and the Model Clauses discussed above, the Model Clauses control and then the Privacy Shield
						Principles control. To learn more about the Frameworks and to view our certification page,
						please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. <br><br>Prior to the invalidation of Privacy
						Shield, we relied on our Privacy Shield certification to transfer Personal Data and other
						information that we receive from the EU and Switzerland to Hollyhock Software in the U.S. As
						noted above, we currently rely on the Model Clauses. <br><br>We process this data in accordance
						with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice and Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer,
						Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, Recourse, Enforcement and Liability
						(“Privacy Shield Principles”), as described below.</p>
					<h3><b>Notice And Choice</b></h3>
					<p>This Privacy Policy provides notice of the Personal Data collected and transferred under the
						Privacy Shield and the choice that you have with respect to such Personal Data. It also provides
						information about other Privacy Shield Principles that are set forth below. When we process
						Personal Data collected through the Service on behalf of our customers, the customer will be
						responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice to its Users, as the customer controls
						the Personal Data it has submitted to our Service. Except as required or permitted by applicable
						law, we honor all customers' requests from their Users to limit use or disclosure of Users'
						Personal Data.</p>
					<h3><b>Accountability for Onward Transfers</b></h3>
					<p>We may be accountable for the Personal Data we receive under the Privacy Shield that we may
						transfer to third-party service providers (as described in the “Disclosure of Personal Data”
						section above) if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield
						Principles and we are responsible if they do so and for the harm caused.</p>
					<h3><b>Security</b></h3>
					<p>We maintain security measures to protect Personal Data as described in the “Security” section of
						this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<h3><b>Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation</b></h3>
					<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, and
						that it is accurate, complete and current for as long as long as we retain it. We will keep your
						Personal Data only for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this
						Privacy Policy, or for the duration required by law or our customer agreement, whichever is the
						longer.</p>
					<h3><b>Access</b></h3>
					<p>You have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data where it is
						inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. When we process
						Personal Data on behalf of our customers, the customer will be responsible to respond to
						requests for exercising your rights. We honor all customers' requests from their Users to
						access, correct, amend, or delete Personal Data.</p>
					<h3><b>Recourse, Enforcement, Liability</b></h3>
					<p>In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Hollyhock Software commits to
						resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data. European
						Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should
						first contact Hollyhock Software as follows: <br><br>Email: softwarehollyhock@gmail.com
						<br>Phone: +91 997-105-6466 <br>Hollyhock Software PVT LTD, H15, H Block, Sector 63, Noida, Uttar
						Pradesh 201301 <br>Attention: Privacy</p>
					<p>Hollyhock Software has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy
						Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism. If you have an unresolved
						privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our
						U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
						https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. <br><br>If your complaint is not resolved
						through these channels, under certain conditions a binding arbitration option may be available
						before a Privacy Shield Panel. For additional information, please visit:
						<br>https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction. <br><br>Swiss individuals
						with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Hollyhock Software at: <br><br>privacy@Hollyhock Software.com <br><br>Hollyhock Software has further
						committed to cooperate with the panel established by the Swiss Federal Data Protection and
						Information Commissioner (FDPIC) with regard to unresolved Privacy Shield complaints concerning
						human resources data transferred from Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.
						<br><br> We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade
						Commission with respect to Personal Data received or transferred pursuant to the Frameworks.</p>
					<h3><b>Cookies</b></h3>
					<p>We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to optimize the functionality of the
						Website, help us understand how the Website is used and provide you with interest-based
						advertising based upon a user's browsing activities and interests. For more information about
						the cookies and similar technologies used on our Website, please refer to our Cookie Policy and
						Security page.</p>
					<h3><b>Links to Other Websites</b></h3>
					<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website and the Service and not to any third-party sites
						or hosted services you may find or access through our Website. If you submit Personal Data to
						any of those sites or services, your information will be governed by their privacy policies. We
						encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or a hosted service you
						use.</p>
					<h3><b>Social Media Widgets</b></h3>
					<p>The Website and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and
						widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect
						your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Website, and may set a cookie to enable the
						feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third
						party or hosted directly on the Website or the Service. Your interactions with these features
						are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>
					<h3><b>Do Not Track</b></h3>
					<p>Currently, various browsers - including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - offer a “do not
						track” or “DNT'' option that relies on technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to
						the websites visited by the user about the user's browsers DNT preference setting. Hollyhock Software does not currently commit to responding to browser's DNT preference across its Sites
						and Services, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups,
						technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user
						intent. Hollyhock Software takes privacy and choices regarding privacy seriously and will make
						efforts to continue to monitor the development around DNT browser technology and the
						implementation of a standard for DNT.</p>
					<h3><b>Security</b></h3>
					<p>We take precautions to ensure the security of your Personal Data. We follow generally accepted
						standards to protect the Personal Data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
						receive it. When you enter your login information on the Service, all information to and from
						the service is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). For more information on our data
						security policies, please check here. <br><br>That said, like any hosted service provider, we
						cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties or unauthorized personnel will not gain access
						to your Personal Data despite our efforts. You should note that in using the Website and the
						Service, your information will travel through third-party infrastructures which are not under
						our control. <br><br>We cannot protect, nor does this Privacy Policy apply to, any information
						that you transmit to other users of the Website or the Service. You should never transmit
						personal or identifying information to other users. <br><br>If you have any questions about
						security on the Website or the Service, you can contact us.</p>
					<h3><b>Privacy Policy Changes</b></h3>
					<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Hollyhock Software may change its Privacy Policy
						from time to time, and in Hollyhock Software sole discretion. If we make any material changes to
						this Privacy Policy, we will either notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in
						your account) or by means of a notice on the Website and/or within the Service prior to the
						change becoming effective, or as otherwise required by the applicable law. We encourage you to
						periodically review the Website for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your
						continued use of the Website and the Service after any change in this Privacy Policy takes
						effect will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
